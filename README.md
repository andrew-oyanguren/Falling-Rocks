### General information
This coding challenge was definitely a challenge for me in the 4 hour window, and I was not able to complete the javascript portion. I decided to create comments describing what I was working on when the time ran out. The way I approached this project was to create a button that would clear the input column and run a function that would add a "table" into a random index of an array. I created a random nummber the length of my array, and passed it into the array accessing the innerText value of that random index. My theory was to create span classes that  would each represent a box in a 4 column by 5 row grid template, and pass the a value of which represents either a rock, a table or a stack into its innerText property. 

Then I wanted to create conditional statements that targeted sibling elements innerText values. I wrote down my thought process and what I was working on with comments in my JavaScript. I apologies if my Javascript looks messy with those comments. When I realized how fast the time went by I wanted to make sure I showed my efforts. I also added a button in the middle that would eventually show the output after all conditionals were applied.

I regret spending as much time as I did on adding those 9 rock elements to my array of spans, and I am sure there is a much better way to achieve the same thing. I rushed at the end to add the start column button and I tried to represent my progress by looping through the output column, and adding the table to the input column.

I will continue on it tomorrow, and out of respect to the rules I wanted to be honest with my progress, but I still want to complete it. It's a cool challenge and I think I can learn more from completing it.

Thanks Ryan for the Challenge.
